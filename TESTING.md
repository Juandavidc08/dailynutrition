Here is the link for the deployed website: [Daily Nutrition](https://juandavidc08.github.io/dailynutrition/)

I successfully navigated through the entire project, and there were numerous changes made from the beginning to the end result. Throughout the process, I primarily utilized Google DevTools to enhance the appearance of the page. I conducted thorough page by page to ensure everything was correct.
